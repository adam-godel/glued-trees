# Glued Trees
This repository contains the code for the latest version of a quantum circuit implementation for the glued trees algorithm. I began working on this project as part of [QRISE 2024](https://github.com/adam-godel/qrise2024-classiq-challenge) for [Classiq](https://github.com/Classiq). I was selected as a winner of QRISE and the research exchange has since ended, but I am still working with Classiq to greatly improve the algorithm and run as large of an implementation as possible on real quantum hardware.

If you are currently reading this, the development of this repository is in progress. Please check back later for a thorough description of the problem and an initial working version of the algorithm.
